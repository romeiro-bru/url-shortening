# Shortly / URL Shortening API Challenge

> Challenge project given by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## The challenge 🕵️
This is my solution to the [URL Shortening API Challenge](https://shrtco.de/QA6b9W).
<br>
The challenge is to build out this [landing page](https://shrtco.de/JwmR16), integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://shrtco.de/docs/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
* Shorten any valid URL ✔️
* See a list of their shortened links ✔️
* Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
* Receive an error message when the form is submitted if: the input field is empty ✔️
